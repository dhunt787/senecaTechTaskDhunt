Developed using React, Typescript and the MUI 5 library.

## To run:
npm install
npm start

## Assumptions:
I assumed the shape of the data being fed into the component. In reality it maybe different, but I was trying to make my work with the shape.
I was under the belief that I would not use the same data as in the animation. 

## Limitations:
THe number of answers is not very scalable, but if you change the interface defining the dataset, it can be.
Because I use a map and a custom box component to house each answer, it should be handle more data being provided to the component in the form of props.

Not achieved:
I struggled to achieve the animation and background color changing when working the MUI library.
